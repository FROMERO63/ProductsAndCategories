# ProductsAndCategories

## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a functional database to house e-commerce inforamtion about departments, products and tags
The database would not only store the information but allow for adding, editing, 
This solved the problem of wanting to store large amounts of editable information for an e-commerce site.
I learned database management through use of Express, Sequelize and Mysql database
The result is a functional database.


## Installation

With starter code, I implemented the backend of an e-commerce site by taking the existing code and connecting the database from express to mysql using sequelize. I set up the routes and the models. I also connected the models.

## Usage

In the terminal, log in to mysql and source and seed the database

Log out of mysql and run NODE server.js to create the connection to the database. App will be listening on the specified port

Open Insomnia and enter in routes to view, add, edit, and delete information using specific routes
